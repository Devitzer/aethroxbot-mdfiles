# Introduction

Welcome to the **AethroxBot Wiki!** <br> <br>


This wiki is for members so that you know in detail how to use each command!
Check out the other sub chapters in the Introduction tab so that you know what certain things mean inside the wiki. <br> <br>


I suggest that you should **first** check out how Arguements work and also how they are Syntaxed! <br>
You can find them here: [Arguements](introduction/arguements.md) and [Syntax](introduction/syntax.md)
