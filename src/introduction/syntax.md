# Syntax

Listed in parameters you may have seen that command arguement types have been stuff such as "String" or "Boolean", and you wondered. What does that mean? Here is an explanation of all types. <br> <br>


## Arguement Syntaxes

### String <br>
> A string arguement is a fancy programming word for "Text". Here is an example of a string. ``"Hello, I am a string!".``

### Boolean <br>
> A boolean is yet, another fancy programming word but instead for "True or False" or "Yes or No" or "Y or N", in the parameters I will say if it is "True or False" or "Yes or No" and you know. Here is an example of a boolean. ``"true".``

### User <br>
> A user is in fact, not a fancy programming word which means what it says, a user inside discord. Specifically a mention, not a User ID. Here is an example of a User. ``"@Electro#9999".``

### User ID <br>
> Just like a user, except it's their ID. Here is an example of a User ID. ``"795410850839265330".``

### Role <br>
> A role that users have. Here is an example of a role. ``"@Owner"``.

### Duration <br>
> A duration is a duration, simple. Here is an example of a duration. ``"1d/1m/1w/1m/1y"``.

## Secondary Fields <br>
Secondary fields are as an example, when an arguement is listed like ``(Boolean | Required)``. <br>
The secondary field is what is after the "|" seperator. This only has a few so I will list them here. <br>

### Required <br>
> Required means that the arguement is required, or else you will get an error. Here is an example of a required arguement. "``(Boolean | Required)``".

### Not Required <br>
> Not Required means that the arguement is not required. Here is an example of a non required arguement. "``(Boolean | Not Required)``"

### Vacantable <br>
> Vacantable means that the arguement is suggested to be filled, but is not required. Here is an example of a vacantable arguement. "``(Boolean | Vacantable)``"
